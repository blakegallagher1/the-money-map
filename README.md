# The Money Map 📊

Fully automated YouTube channel that turns Federal Reserve economic data into cinematic, data-driven video content.

## Architecture

```
FRED API → Data Ingestion → Story Discovery → Script Writer → Voiceover (TTS)
                                                    ↓
                              Enhanced Renderer → AI B-Roll → Final Assembly → YouTube
```

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
export FRED_API_KEY="your_key_here"
```

## Run

```bash
# Full pipeline for one episode
python scripts/orchestrator.py

# Build a narrated non-FRED episode from a JSON spec
python scripts/custom_episode_builder.py --episode data/cre_balance_sheet_fortress/episode.json

# Generate still-image visuals for a narrated episode, then rebuild with those visuals
python scripts/episode_image_visuals.py --plan data/cre_balance_sheet_fortress/image_plan.json
python scripts/custom_episode_builder.py --episode data/cre_balance_sheet_fortress/episode.json

# Generate Sora clips for a narrated episode, then rebuild with those visuals
python scripts/sora_episode_visuals.py --plan data/cre_balance_sheet_fortress/sora_shots.json
python scripts/custom_episode_builder.py --episode data/cre_balance_sheet_fortress/episode.json

# Just render enhanced episode N
python scripts/enhanced_renderer.py N

# Just generate thumbnail for episode N
python scripts/enhanced_thumbnail.py N

# Full assembly with b-roll interleaving
python scripts/final_assembly.py N
```

Custom narrated episodes write their combined script to `data/<slug>/voiceover_script.txt`,
their final voiceover MP3 to `data/<slug>/voiceover.mp3`, and their final video to
`output/<slug>.mp4`. Generated still-image visuals land under `output/imagegen/<slug>/`.
