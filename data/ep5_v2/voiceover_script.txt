1.4 percent.

GDP Growth Rate just dropped 26.3 percent in a single year. That's one of the most dramatic shifts we've seen in recent economic data. In this episode, we're going to break down exactly what's happening, what's driving it, and what it means for you. Let's follow the data.

Right now, gdp growth rate stands at 1.4 percent. One year ago, it was at 1.9 percent. That's a 26.3 percent decline in twelve months. To understand why that matters, you have to see the full picture. This chart shows the complete history.

Watch how gdp growth rate has moved over the past decade. You can see periods of stability... periods of gradual change... and then these sharp inflection points where everything accelerates. The move we're seeing now is one of those inflection points. The data is moving faster than at almost any point in the last ten years.

But gdp growth rate doesn't exist in isolation. To understand the full story, we need to look at what's connected. Personal Consumption is currently at $21.5 trillion... that's up 4.7 percent year over year. Unemployment Rate is currently at 4.3 percent... that's up 2.4 percent year over year. Consumer Sentiment is currently at 56.4... that's down 1.1 percent year over year.

When you put these numbers side by side, a clear picture emerges. These aren't random fluctuations. They're interconnected forces... each one reinforcing the others. And together, they tell a story that's more complex than any single headline.

GDP growth at 1.4 percent is technically still positive... the economy is still expanding. But the trajectory matters more than the number itself. A year ago we were growing at 1.9 percent. That deceleration is significant. At this pace, the economy is barely keeping up with population growth. Historically, when GDP growth drops below 1.5 percent, the probability of entering a recession within the next 12 months rises sharply. We're not there yet. But the margin of safety is razor thin. One external shock... a trade war, a banking stress event, an oil spike... could tip the balance.

That's the story behind gdp growth rate right now. The data doesn't lie... and it often tells us things months before the headlines catch up.
