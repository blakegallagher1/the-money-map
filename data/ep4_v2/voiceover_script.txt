$2.94.

Regular Gas Price just dropped 6.3 percent in a single year. That's one of the most dramatic shifts we've seen in recent economic data. In this episode, we're going to break down exactly what's happening, what's driving it, and what it means for you. Let's follow the data.

Right now, regular gas price stands at $2.94. One year ago, it was at $3.13. That's a 6.3 percent decline in twelve months. To understand why that matters, you have to see the full picture. This chart shows the complete history.

Watch how regular gas price has moved over the past decade. You can see periods of stability... periods of gradual change... and then these sharp inflection points where everything accelerates. The move we're seeing now is one of those inflection points. The data is moving faster than at almost any point in the last ten years.

But regular gas price doesn't exist in isolation. To understand the full story, we need to look at what's connected. CPI: Energy is currently at 281.4... that's up 0.9 percent year over year. Consumer Price Index is currently at 326.6... that's up 2.1 percent year over year. Consumer Sentiment is currently at 56.4... that's down 1.1 percent year over year.

When you put these numbers side by side, a clear picture emerges. These aren't random fluctuations. They're interconnected forces... each one reinforcing the others. And together, they tell a story that's more complex than any single headline.

Cheaper gas sounds like good news, and for your wallet, it is. The average American drives about 13,500 miles per year. At current prices versus last year, that saves roughly $150 to $200 annually. But falling gas prices often signal something deeper. They can reflect weakening global demand... meaning the world economy is slowing down. Oil prices are a leading indicator. When demand for energy drops, it usually means factories are producing less, shipping is declining, and consumers are pulling back. So while you're paying less at the pump... the reason you're paying less might not be something to celebrate.

That's the story behind regular gas price right now. The data doesn't lie... and it often tells us things months before the headlines catch up.
