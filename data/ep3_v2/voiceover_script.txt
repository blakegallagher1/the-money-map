$37.6 trillion.

Federal Debt just risen 6.1 percent in a single year. That's one of the most dramatic shifts we've seen in recent economic data. In this episode, we're going to break down exactly what's happening, what's driving it, and what it means for you. Let's follow the data.

Right now, federal debt stands at $37.6 trillion. One year ago, it was at $35.5 trillion. That's a 6.1 percent increase in twelve months. To understand why that matters, you have to see the full picture. This chart shows the complete history.

Watch how federal debt has moved over the past decade. You can see periods of stability... periods of gradual change... and then these sharp inflection points where everything accelerates. The move we're seeing now is one of those inflection points. The data is moving faster than at almost any point in the last ten years.

But federal debt doesn't exist in isolation. To understand the full story, we need to look at what's connected. Federal Funds Rate is currently at 3.6 percent... that's down 15.9 percent year over year. 10-Year Treasury Yield is currently at 4.0 percent. GDP Growth Rate is currently at 1.4 percent... that's down 26.3 percent year over year.

When you put these numbers side by side, a clear picture emerges. These aren't random fluctuations. They're interconnected forces... each one reinforcing the others. And together, they tell a story that's more complex than any single headline.

To put this in perspective, $37.6 trillion divided among every American means each person... including children... owes roughly $112,000. A family of four carries $448,000 in national debt. Now, government debt isn't like personal debt. Countries don't pay it off the same way you pay off a credit card. But the interest payments alone are now over $1 trillion per year... more than we spend on defense. Every dollar going to interest is a dollar not going to infrastructure, education, or healthcare. And with rates still elevated, that interest bill is only growing.

That's the story behind federal debt right now. The data doesn't lie... and it often tells us things months before the headlines catch up.
